Abstract:

Repetitive transients are typical symptoms of rotating faults and their extraction can be used to indicate early rotating faults. A main concern is to extract the cyclo-stationarity of repetitive transients that is insensitive to impulsive noises. Traditional blind deconvolution methods aim to recover impulsive signals from a time domain. By considering the cyclo-stationarity of repetitive transients, a novel blind deconvolution (BD) technique, coined as prior-unknown blind deconvolution technique, is proposed to extract the cyclo-stationarity of repetitive transients. The proposed technique finds an inverse filter by minimizing the optimal criterion defined on envelope spectrum (ES). Moreover, the proposed method does not need prior knowledge about initialization of BD. Based on the proposed method and the generalized Lp/Lq norm, a demonstration is introduced to show how to design a BD algorithm for extracting the cyclo-stationarity of repetitive transients.Results showed that the proposed method is superior to traditional time-domain BD algorithms according to the metrics of detection performance and robustness.
